The goals of this project is to provide a framework for
- running,
- visualizing (in 2d),
- and audiating
physics simulations as simply as possible, while providing full control over the simulation.
The framework should allow for all sorts of interactions between objects, not just the physics from our universe.

# Implementation goals

- Simulations are written in Typescipt
- It should be easy to interface with the system
  - A powerful and easy to use CLI and development enviorment
  - Wrappers around the CLI for diffrent programming languages
